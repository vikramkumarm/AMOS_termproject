###                   Buckling of a Simply Supported Rectangular Plate under Bending and Compression

__Problem Statement__<br>
A simply supported rectangular plate (on all sides) (Fig.1) is considered with axes as shown. The distributed forces are shown in Fig.1 along the sides x=0 and x=a. The distributed force is acting in the middle plane of the plate , the intensity of the applied forces is given by<br><br>
$$N_x = N_o\left(1-\frac{\alpha y}{b}\right) \tag{a}$$<br>

where,<br>
$N_o$ is the intensity of compressive force at the edge y = 0 and $\alpha$ is a numerical factor. By changing the value for $\alpha$ we can obtain particular cases, for example for $\alpha$=0 we obtain UDL compressive force, for $\alpha$=2 we have Pure bending.<br> If α<0 we have a combination of bending and compression and if α>0, there will be a similar combination of bending and tension.<br>
Our aim is to analyse different cases of $\alpha$ and plot the results.
